  <h4>Cookies</h4>

<p>We collect information directly from you in a number of ways.  One way is through our use of ‘cookies’.

They help us to understand how our customers and potential customers use our website so we can develop and improve the design, layout, content and function of the site.  Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer’s hard drive by websites that you visit.  They save and retrieve pieces of information about your visit to the website – for example, how you entered the site, how you navigated through the site and what information and documentation was of interest to you.  This means that when you go back to a website, it can give you tailored options based on the information it has stored about you on your last visit.</p>

You can also delete any cookies that are already stored on your computer’s hard drive.
