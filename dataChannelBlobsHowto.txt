Steps to send blobs over dataChannel:

Support for sending Blobs does not exist yet, however "Binary support exists (using ArrayBuffer/ArrayBufferView). Blobs are the only thing not supported yet."(http://code.google.com/p/webrtc/issues/detail?id=2276)

How to use ArrayBuffer/ArrayBufferView:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer

Note: You can not directly manipulate the contents of an ArrayBuffer; instead, you create one of the typed array objects or a DataView object which represents the buffer in a specific format, and use that to read and write the contents of the buffer.

Steps (e.g. storing file object in ArrayBuffer):
var file = files[0]; //file.size = 154
var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(160); //size in bytes (must be divisable by 4)
var view = new Int32Array(buffer); //view.byteLength = 160
view = file; //store file in buffer. view.size is now 154 

//Test locally accesability of the object by viewing it:
url = window.URL.createObjectURL(view); //Creates local object URL to view file.

//Send over datachannel:
dc.send(view);

in short:
read file with Filereader() using readAsArrayBuffer(file)
use reader.result (which is an arrayBuffer) and send that over the datachannel.
dc.send(reader.result); //which is an ArrayBuffer and not a blob yet.
At the receiving end, create the blob: 
var blob = new Blob([reader.result], {type:"image/png"});
